<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_65 c017'>THE Defeat of the <span class='sc'>Spanish Armada</span>
being the most glorious Victory that
was ever obtained at Sea, and the
most important to the <i>British</i> Nation, every
Method deserves some Praise, that may in a
suitable Manner propagate the Memory of it.
Our Ancestors, that were personally interested
in it, were so careful it should not pass into
Oblivion, that they procured the Engagements
between the two Fleets to be represented in ten
curious Pieces of Tapestry, with the Portraits
of the several <i>English</i> Captains, taken from the
Life, worked in the Borders, which are now
placed, some in the Royal Wardrobe, some in
the House of Lords, the most august Assembly
of the Kingdom, there to remain as a lasting
Memorial of the Triumphs of <i>British</i> Valour,
guided by <i>British</i> Counsels. But because Time,
or Accident, or Moths may deface these valuable
Shadows, we have endeavoured to preserve
their Likeness in the preceding Prints,
which, by being multiplied and dispersed in
various Hands, may meet with that Security
from the Closets of the Curious, which
the Originals must scarce always hope for,
even from the Sanctity of the Place they are
kept in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus far we have been able to go within
our own Province; but as a more particular
Detail of the Circumstances of this glorious
Expedition, which lye blended in our Histories
with other Matters, may not be altogether
unacceptable, we shall beg Leave to offer
the following brief Account of it, collected
from the most authentic Writers and Manuscripts.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>SECT. I.</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_65 c017'>THE Author and Undertaker of this ever
memorable Expedition was <i>Philip</i> II.
King of <i>Spain</i>, eldest Son of the renowned Emperor
<i>Charles</i> V. In the Year 1554, he married
<i>Mary</i> I. Queen of <i>England</i>, with a View of uniting,
by this Marriage, the <i>English</i> Dominions
to those large and noble Territories of which he
was Heir-Apparent. But all his Projects were
defeated by a False-Conception the Queen had
in 1555; and especially by her Death, which
happened on <i>Novemb.</i> 17, 1558.—In 1555,
<i>October</i> 25, he became King of <i>Spain</i>, and the
Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging,
upon the voluntary Resignation of his Father
<i>Charles</i> V.</p>

<p class='c009'>As to King <i>Philip</i>’s real Views and Motives
in this Expedition, they seem to have been
these:</p>

<p class='c009'>I. A firm Hope and certain Prospect as he
imagin’d, of easily acquiring so considerable an
Addition to his Dominions, as the flourishing
Kingdoms of <i>England</i> and <i>Ireland</i>. Kingdoms
whose Advantages and Excellencies he was well
acquainted withal; and from whence he could
be continually supplied with Tin, Lead, Wool,
and many other useful, necessary, and profitable
Commodities.</p>

<p class='c009'>II. He was also excited by another Motive,
which is generally sufficient for Conquerors;
and it was this: <i>England</i> and <i>Ireland</i> stood
very convenient for him, as being near his Dominions
in the Low-Countries; and might, by
their advantageous Situation, and the many
good Harbours they abound with, have rendered
him Master of the Trade and Navigation
of these Northern Parts of the World; and,
what is more, they would have enabled him to
carry it on throughout all <i>North</i> and <i>South-America</i>,
exclusively of all others; which is such
an Advantage as cannot well be expressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>III. Moreover these Islands had proved, and
might always prove a grievous Thorn in his
Side. For, by reason of their Situation, the
<i>English</i> could, at any Time, almost totally obstruct
the Navigation of the <i>Netherlands</i>, and
destroy all their Traffick by Sea. Because, as
it must unavoidably be carried on almost within
Sight of the <i>British</i> Coasts, so long as the
Inhabitants of those Islands remained independent
of him<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, and were Masters at Sea, they
could seize, with the utmost Ease, the Shipping
sent from the Ports of <i>Flanders</i> to the several
Parts of the World. What lay therefore so
convenient, and was in other Hands so dangerous
a Neighbour, must be purchas’d at any
Rate.</p>

<p class='c009'>IV. Revenge may be assigned as another
Motive of this Expedition. Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>
had assisted all along the States of the United
Provinces, in their several Attempts to shake
off the <i>Spanish</i> Yoke. Now, that surely was
a very great Provocation: And Forgiveness of
Injuries, it is well known, was then, no more
than at present, a <i>Spaniard</i>’s Virtue. To be
revenged therefore of such a constant Enemy as
<i>Elizabeth</i> had been, may well be suppos’d to
have been an additional Inducement to this Undertaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>V. This other important Motive is assigned
by <i>Hakluyt</i><a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c019'><sup>[2]</sup></a>: “King <i>Philip</i> deemed this to
be the most ready and direct Course, to recover
his hereditary Possession of the <i>Low-Countries</i>.
For, having with little Advantage,
for above twenty Years together, waged
War against the <i>Netherlands</i>, after mature
Deliberation, he thought it most convenient
to assault them once more by Sea, which had
been fruitlessly attempted several Times before
for want of sufficient Forces. And he
thought good to begin with <i>England</i>, being
persuaded, that the Conquest of that Island
was less difficult than the Conquest of <i>Holland</i>
and <i>Zealand</i>. Moreover, the <i>Spaniards</i>
were of Opinion, that it would be far more
behoveful for their King to conquer <i>England</i>
and the <i>Low-Countries</i> at once, than to be
constrained continually to maintain a warlike
Navy, to defend his <i>East</i> and <i>West-India</i>
Fleets from the <i>English</i>.”</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c009'>These (with a Desire of restoring the <i>Roman-Catholick</i>
Religion) seem to have been the real
and true Motives of this great Expedition.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Reasons alleged by <i>Philip</i> were these<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c019'><sup>[3]</sup></a>:</p>
<p class='c021'>I. That <i>Elizabeth</i> had, from the first assisted
his rebellious Subjects in the <i>Netherlands</i>,
with Men and Money, and spirited them up
against him, her greatest Friend and Benefactor;
whom she was indebted to for her Life, when
her Sister Queen <i>Mary</i> and <i>Gardiner</i> were
for removing her out of the Way.</p>

<p class='c009'>II. <i>Drake</i>, and others of her Subjects, had
committed several Depredations in <i>Spain</i> and
<i>America</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>III. She had been so unnatural as to stop
his Money, when, for fear of Pirates, it had
been landed in her Dominions; and had put an
Embargo on the Vessels employed to carry it
to the <i>Low-Countries</i>: (As is related by <i>Camden</i>,
under the Year 1568.)</p>

<p class='c009'>IV. She had acknowledged his Enemy Don
<i>Antonio</i> King of <i>Portugal</i>, and armed him against
<i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>V. That it was by her Instruction and Advice
the Duke of <i>Alençon</i> had been crowned
King of <i>Brabant</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>VI. And, moreover, she herself had accepted
the Sovereignty of the <i>Low-Countries</i>, and
sent the Earl of <i>Leicester</i> thither with considerable
Forces; which was an open Declaration
of War.</p>

<p class='c009'>VII. That he undertook it, to revenge the
Death of the innocent Queen of <i>Scots</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>VIII. And in Compliance with the Holy Father
<i>Innocent</i> VIII.’s earnest Injunctions, who
ceased not to exhort and importune him, to abolish
Heresy in <i>England</i>, and replant the <i>Roman-Catholick</i>
Religion there.</p>
<hr class='c020' />
<p class='c009'>In short therefore, the Aim and Design of
the King of <i>Spain</i> in this great Expedition, was
to conquer <i>England</i>, in order to come more
easily at the revolted <i>Netherlands</i>, and facilitate
their Reduction to his Obedience; as also,
for the Sake of so meritorious an Action, as
the bringing this Island back to the Catholick
Religion: And to be revenged, at the same
Time, for the Disgrace, Contempt, and Dishonour,
he had, at several Times, received from
the <i>English</i> Nation; and for divers others real
or pretended Injuries, which had made a deep
Impression on his proud and revengeful Spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Animated and spurred on by these Motives,
King <i>Philip</i> made such vast Preparations for
his intended Conquest, as had hardily ever been
known before in any Age, or Nation: Whether
we consider the Time spent about them;
or the prodigious Strength and Quantity of the
Materials of all Kinds that were provided.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for the Time spent about these Preparations;
King <i>Philip</i> seems to have form’d this
Design as early as the Year 1583. <a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c019'><sup>[4]</sup></a>For, in
that Year, he ordered <i>Alexander</i> Duke of
<i>Parma</i>, Governor of the <i>Low-Countries</i>, to
procure an exact Account and Description of
the Harbours, Castles, Rivers, and Roads belonging
to <i>England</i>, and transmit them to him;
which was accordingly done: And in this
<i>Francis Throckmorton</i> appears to have been
concerned. But, according to <i>Rapin</i>, <a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c019'><sup>[5]</sup></a>this
Project was formed by <i>Philip</i> only from the
Time <i>Mary</i> Queen of <i>Scots</i> had been persuaded
to convey to him her Right to <i>England</i>,
as being the only Means to restore the <i>Catholick</i>
Religion<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c019'><sup>[6]</sup></a>: According to the received
Maxim in the Church of <i>Rome</i>, That an Heretick
is unworthy and incapable of enjoying a
Crown; <i>Philip</i> thought he might justly claim
that of <i>England</i>, as being the next <i>Catholick</i>
Prince descended from the House of <i>Lancaster</i>;
namely, from <i>Catharine</i> Daughter of <i>John</i> of
<i>Ghent</i> Duke of <i>Lancaster</i>, married in 1389 to
<i>Henry</i>, then Prince, and afterwards King, of
<i>Castile</i>. Upon this Descent therefore, and the
Queen of <i>Scots</i> Conveyance and Will, he had
projected the Conquest of <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>However it be, or whenever these Preparations
were begun, it is certain that King <i>Philip</i>
assembled so powerful a Fleet, and so well furnished
with all kinds of Provisions and Ammunition,
that, thinking it unconquerable by
human Power, he gave it the Title of the
<span class='sc'>Invincible Armada</span>.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c019'><sup>[7]</sup></a>This Fleet consisted of one hundred and
thirty two Ships, (besides twenty Caravels for
the Service of the Army, and ten Salves with
six Oars apiece,) containing fifty nine thousand
one hundred, and twenty Tons; three thousand,
one hundred, and sixty five Cannons; eight
thousand, seven hundred, and sixty six Sailors;
two thousand and eighty eight Galley-Slaves,
and twenty one thousand, eight hundred, and
fifty five Soldiers; besides Noblemen and Voluntiers<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c019'><sup>[8]</sup></a>.
For there was not a Family in <i>Spain</i>
of any Note, but what had a Son, a Brother,
or a Kinsman in the Fleet<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c019'><sup>[9]</sup></a>. Of these Voluntiers
there were two hundred and twenty four;
attended by four hundred and fifty six Servants
bearing Arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were also two hundred and thirty
eight Gentlemen more, maintained by the
King; with one hundred and sixty three Servants.
An hundred and seventy seven Persons,
with two Engineers, one Physician, one Surgeon,
and thirty Servants belonging to the Artillery;
eighty five Physicians and Surgeons
for the Hospital-Ships; three and twenty Gentlemen
belonging to the Duke of <i>Medina-Sidonia</i>’s
Court, and fifty Servants; seventeen
Superintendants General of the Army; and
one hundred Servants more, belonging to them,
or to the Officers of Justice, who were twenty
in Number<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c019'><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nay even there were in it one hundred and
eighty Capuchins, Dominicans, Jesuits, and
Mendicant Friars; with <i>Martin Alarco</i>, Vicar
of the Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c009'>And because none were allowed to have
Wives or Concubines on board, some Women
had hired Ships to follow the Fleet; two or
three of which Ships were driven by the Storm
on the Coast of <i>France</i><a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c019'><sup>[11]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most of the Ships of this <span class='sc'>Armada</span><a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c019'><sup>[12]</sup></a> were
of an uncommon Size, Strength, and Thickness,
more like floating Castles than any thing
else; and they were cased above Water with
thick Planks to hinder the Cannon-Balls from
piercing their Sides. The Masts also were
braced round with strong pitched Ropes, to
save them from being soon shatter’d or broke
by the Shot.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then as to Ammunition, <a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c019'><sup>[13]</sup></a>this Fleet had
a very great Number of Cannons, double Cannons,
Culverins, and Field-Pieces for Land-Service;
seven thousand Muskets and Calievers;
ten thousand Halberts and Partizans;
one hundred and twenty thousand Cannon-Balls;
<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c019'><sup>[14]</sup></a>one hundred Quintals of Lead for
Bullets (each Quintal being a hundred weight,)
twelve thousand Quintals of Match; fifty six
thousand Quintals of Gunpowder; and also,
Waggons, and other Carriages; Horses, Mules,
and other Instruments and Necessaries for Conveyance
by Land; Torches, Lanthorns, Canvas,
Hides, Lead; Chains, Whips, Butchering-Knives,
Halters, and other Instruments of
Death and Slavery<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c019'><sup>[15]</sup></a>; and Spades, Mattocks,
Baskets, and every thing else requisite for Pioneers
Work; as also eight hundred Mules for
drawing the Ordnance and Carriages.</p>

<p class='c009'>Proportionable to these Forces was their great
Store of Provisions of every Sort: <a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c019'><sup>[16]</sup></a>for, besides
Raisins in great abundance, they had
eight thousand Quintals of Fish; three thousand
Quintals of Rice; six thousand three
hundred and twenty <a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c019'><sup>[17]</sup></a>Septiers of Beans, Pease,
<i>&amp;c.</i> eleven thousand three hundred and ninety
eight Pounds of Olive-Oyl; thirty three
thousand eight hundred and seventy Measures
of Vinegar; ninety six thousand Quintals of
Biscuit; three thousand four hundred and fifty
eight Quintals of Goats Cheese; six thousand
five hundred Quintals of Bacon; one hundred
and forty seven thousand Pipes of Wine;
twelve thousand Pipes of Water, <i>&amp;c.</i>—Provisions
in a word they had for six Months;
and so well furnished were they, that Sir <i>Francis
Drake</i> observes, in a Letter of his, <a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c019'><sup>[18]</sup></a>they
had Provisions of Bread and Wine sufficient
to maintain forty thousand Men for a whole
Year.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole Fleet, in general, is said<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c019'><sup>[19]</sup></a> to
have contained thirty two thousand Persons, and
cost every Day thirty thousand Ducats<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c019'><sup>[20]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The General of the Land Forces, and the
Commander in Chief in the whole Expedition,
was Don <i>Alfonso Perez de Guzman</i>, Duke of
<i>Medina Sidonia</i>; and the Admiral was Don
<i>Juan Martinez de Recalde</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was not in <i>Spain</i> only, that such
great Preparations were carrying on, for the
Invasion of <i>England</i>. For, <i>Alexander</i> Duke
of <i>Parma</i> was also making on his Side prodigious
and amazing Preparations, to assist in this
grand Design.</p>

<p class='c009'>He gathered together out of <i>Spain</i>, <i>France</i>,
<i>Savoy</i>, <i>Italy</i>, <i>Naples</i>, <i>Sicily</i>, <i>Germany</i>, and even
out of <i>America</i>, a very considerable and
choice Army; <a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c019'><sup>[21]</sup></a>consisting of about forty thousand
Foot, and three thousand Horse; out of
which he selected thirty thousand Foot, and
eighteen hundred Horse, that were to be ready
to pass into <i>England</i>. These Troops were
quarter’d as follows: <a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c019'><sup>[22]</sup></a>Near <i>Nieuport</i> there
lay ready thirty Companies of <i>Italians</i>; ten of
<i>Walloons</i>; and eight of <i>Scots</i>, and as many of
<i>Burgundians</i>: At <i>Dixmude</i> were eighty Companies
of <i>Netherlanders</i>; sixty of <i>Spaniards</i>;
sixty of <i>Germans</i>; and above seven hundred
fugitive <i>English</i>, <i>Scots</i>, and <i>Irish</i>, under the
Command of Sir <i>William Stanley</i>, and <i>Charles
Nevil</i> Earl of <i>Westmoreland</i>. There were
moreover four thousand Men posted at <i>Corrick</i>,
and nine hundred at <i>Watene</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the Transportation of these Forces, the
Duke of <i>Parma</i> prepar’d Ships at <i>Nieuport</i>,
<i>Dunkirk</i>, <i>Antwerp</i>, and other Places; and
caused some new ones to be built with such
Expedition, that they seem’d, as <i>Strada</i> expresses
it, <a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c019'><sup>[23]</sup></a>to be transform’d in a Moment,
from Trees into Ships.</p>

<p class='c009'>More particularly: <a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c019'><sup>[24]</sup></a>In the River of <i>Watten</i>
he caused seventy flat-bottom’d Boats to be
built, each of which could carry thirty Horses;
and to each of them were Bridges fitted for the
convenient Shipping, or Landing of the Horses.
There were in most of them, two Ovens for
baking Bread, with a great Quantity of Saddles,
Bridles, Harness, and a good Number of
Draught-Horses, to draw the Engines, Cannons,
and other Ammunition, after the <i>Spaniards</i>
should be landed. Of the same Form
he had provided two hundred other Vessels at
<i>Nieuport</i>, but not so large. And at <i>Dunkirk</i>
he had assembled thirty eight Men of War;
for the navigating of which, he had hired Sailors
from <i>Bremen</i>, <i>Hamburgh</i>, <i>Emden</i>, and
<i>Genoa</i>. In their Ballast he had put a great
Quantity of Beams, or thick Planks, sharpned
at the Ends, and covered with Iron; but full
of Clasps and Hooks on the Sides, that they
might be easily joined together. At <i>Graveling</i>,
he had provided twenty thousand Casks, which
might in a short Time be fastened together
with Nails and Cords, and reduced into the
Form of a Bridge. Whatever, in a Word, was
necessary for making Bridges, or for choaking
up the Mouths of Havens and Rivers, was by
him got in readiness. And he had even caused
a great Pile of wooden Faggots to be laid
near <i>Nieuport</i>, for erecting a Mount or Rampart.
Whilst he was thus furnishing himself
with all proper Vessels and other Necessaries,
he caused the shallow and sandy Places of Rivers
to be cleared; and had deep Channels cut
in proper Places, from <i>Ghent</i> to <i>Ysendyck</i>,
<i>Sluys</i>, and <i>Nieuport</i>, on purpose to convey the
Ships built at <i>Antwerp</i>, <i>Ghent</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> into the
Sea. Finally, he assembled at <i>Bruges</i> above
one hundred Hoys loaden with Provisions,
which he designed to bring into the Ports of
<i>Flanders</i>, either by the Way of <i>Sluys</i>, or
through the forementioned Channels.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Duke of <i>Guise</i> had also twelve thousand
Men on the Coast of <i>Normandy</i>, ready
to land in the West of <i>England</i> as soon as
the <span class='sc'>Spanish Armada</span> had enter’d the Channel<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c019'><sup>[25]</sup></a>;
but the <i>Spaniards</i> coming two Months
later than they intended, (or for some other
Reasons) the Duke dismissed his Forces about
the End of <i>June</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>And that this famous Expedition might be
supported with spiritual as well as temporal
Weapons<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c019'><sup>[26]</sup></a>, Pope <i>Sixtus</i> V created <i>William
Allen</i>, a seditious <i>English</i> Priest, Cardinal; and
sent him as his Legate into the <i>Low-Countries</i>,
with a Bull; wherein, after enumerating the
several Causes of Complaint the See of <i>Rome</i>
had against Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, (namely her suppressing
the Catholic Religion, her putting the
Queen of <i>Scots</i> to Death, <i>&amp;c.</i>) he renewed
and confirmed the Sentence of Excommunication
pronounced against her by his Predecessors
<i>Pius</i> V and <i>Gregory</i> XIII, deprived her, as
illegitimate, and an Usurper, from all Princely
Dignity, and Dominion over the Kingdoms of
<i>England</i> and <i>Ireland</i>; absolved her Subjects
from their Allegiance; and strictly enjoined
them, upon Pain of <span class='sc'>God</span> Almighty’s Displeasure,
not to lend her any Help or Assistance,
but to join the <i>Spanish</i> Army, and the Duke
of <i>Parma</i>’s Forces, as soon as they should be
landed: Promising withal a plenary Indulgence
and the Pardon of all their Sins, to as
many as would engage in so laudable an Undertaking.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c009'>Such were the extraordinary Preparations
made by the <i>Spaniards</i> for invading <i>England</i>.
Preparations so great and so dreadful, that all
<i>Europe</i> was alarmed at them. Most Sovereigns
expected for some Time, with the utmost Horror
and Astonishment, where the threatening
Storm, which had been so long gathering,
would at last fall. But this, though kept as
a great Secret, did not long escape the great
Sir <i>Francis Walsingham</i>’s Sagacity. <a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c019'><sup>[27]</sup></a>He had
Intelligence from <i>Madrid</i>, that King <i>Philip</i>
had told his Council, he had dispatched an Express
to <i>Rome</i> with a Letter writ with his own
Hand to the Pope, acquainting him with the
true Design of his Preparations, and asking his
Blessing upon it; which for some Reasons he
would not yet disclose to them, ’till the Return
of the Courier. The Secret being thus lodg’d
with the Pope, <i>Walsingham</i>, by the means of
a <i>Venetian</i> Priest retain’d at <i>Rome</i> as his Spy,
got a Copy of the original Letter, which was
stolen out of the Pope’s Cabinet by a Gentleman
of the Bed-Chamber, who took the Keys
out of the Pope’s Pocket whilst he slept. Upon
this Intelligence <i>Walsingham</i> found a Way
to retard the <i>Spanish</i> Invasion for a whole
Year, by getting the <i>Spanish</i> Bills protested at
<i>Genoa</i>, which should have supplied them with
Money to carry on their Preparations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, it may well be supposed,
could not help being extremely anxious about
the issue of the great and dreadful Preparations
that were going on, to deprive her of her
Crown and Dignity, and perhaps of her <a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c019'><sup>[28]</sup></a>Life.
This inclined her more readily to embrace
some Overtures of Peace, made to her by the
<i>Spaniard</i><a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c019'><sup>[29]</sup></a>: But it being soon found out that
they were intended only to lull her asleep, and
induce her, by depending upon a Peace, to be
careless of her own Defence; and moreover,
<i>Henry</i> III King of <i>France</i> sending her Word,
<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c019'><sup>[30]</sup></a>she ought to stand upon her Guard; she did
not therefore rely much on the Negociations
in hand, but took all proper Measures for securing
herself, and protecting her Dominions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her Situation was indeed very melancholy,
and her Fears well grounded: For she was
without so much as one Ally abroad, except
the <i>United-Provinces</i>, which themselves wanted
Assistance; and at home she had a factious and
discontented Party, ready to join with the Enemy:
But, by the Assistance of Heaven, by
her good Management, and the sincere Affection
of the Generality of her People, she surmounted
all Difficulties, and came off Conqueror.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she was sure the <i>Spaniards</i> Preparations
were design’d against her, that she might
not be taken unprovided, she fitted out as strong
a Fleet as she possibly could; and herein so
great was the Diligence of her Subjects, <a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c019'><sup>[31]</sup></a>that
though her Preparations were begun but about
the
1<sup>st</sup>
of <i>November</i> 1587, yet her Fleet was
ready to put to Sea by the
20<sup>th</sup>
of <i>December</i>
the same Year.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c019'><sup>[32]</sup></a><i>Charles</i> Lord <i>Howard</i> of <i>Effingham</i>, High
Admiral of <i>England</i>, a Person of great Prudence
and Bravery, was appointed Commander
in Chief of this whole Fleet. His Instructions
were, To repair to the Westward, in conjunction
with Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> Vice-Admiral,
and Captain <i>John Hawkins</i>, and Captain <i>Martin
Frobisher</i> Rear-Admirals: At the same
Time, the Lord <i>Henry Seymour</i>, second Son
of the late Duke of <i>Somerset</i>, had Orders to
lye on the Coast of <i>Flanders</i>, with forty <i>English</i>
and <i>Dutch</i> Ships (the latter under the
Command of <i>Justin</i> of <i>Nassau</i>, Admiral of
<i>Zealand</i>) to prevent the Duke of <i>Parma</i>’s putting
out to Sea with his Forces.</p>

<p class='c009'>For Land Service, there were disposed along
the Southern Coasts of <i>England</i> twenty thousand
Men. Besides which, two Armies were
raised of choice, well-disciplin’d, and experienced
Men; one (under the Command of <i>Robert
Dudley</i> Earl of <i>Leicester</i>, consisting of
one thousand Horse, and twenty two thousand
Foot,) was encamped at <i>Tilbury</i>, near the
<i>Thames</i> Mouth, for the Safeguard of the City
of <i>London</i>; because it was given out that the
<i>Spaniards</i>, after having joined the Duke of
<i>Parma</i>, intended to come up the <i>Thames</i>,
in order to make themselves Masters of the
Metropolis of the Kingdom. The other Army,
under the Command of <i>Henry Carey</i> Lord
<i>Hunsdon</i>, consisted of thirty four thousand
Foot, and two thousand Horse, and was destined
to guard the Queen’s Person.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Arthur</i> Lord <i>Grey</i>, Sir <i>Francis Knolles</i>,
Sir <i>John Norris</i>, Sir <i>Richard Bingham</i>, and
Sir <i>Roger Williams</i>, Knights, and excellent
Soldiers, were chosen to consult about the best
Way of managing the War at Land. After
mature Deliberation, they thought fit that the
most convenient Landing-Places for the Enemy,
as well out of <i>Spain</i> as out of the <i>Low-Countries</i>,
should be well mann’d and fortify’d, namely
<i>Milford-Haven</i>, <i>Falmouth</i>, <i>Plymouth</i>, <i>Portland</i>,
the Isle of <i>Wight</i>, <i>Portsmouth</i>, the open
Coast of <i>Kent</i> called the <i>Downs</i>, the <i>Thames</i>
Mouth, <i>Harwich</i>, <i>Yarmouth</i>, <i>Hull</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> that
the Train’d Bands, all along the Maritime
Counties, should meet in Arms upon a Signal
given, to defend the said Ports, and do their
best to prevent the Enemy’s landing; and, in
Case of their landing, that they should lay all
the Country waste round about, and leave
neither Booty nor Forage for them; that they
should annoy them Night and Day with continual
Alarms, so as to give them no Rest;
but not venture the Hazard of a Battle, ’till
more Commanders with their Companies should
come up; of whom one in every Shire was
nominated Chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>Moreover, the active Queen, in order to
quicken the Zeal and Diligence of her Subjects,
especially of those who lay near the Sea-Coasts,
caused Letters to be sent to the chief
of them: Wherein, after putting them in mind
of the common and imminent Danger the
whole Nation was in, she told them, that she
“expected on this extraordinary Occasion, a
larger Proportion of Furniture, both for
Horsemen and Footmen; thereby to be in
their best Strength against any Attempt whatsoever,
to be employed, whether about her
own Person, or otherwise. And the Number
she required them to signify to her Privy-Council<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c019'><sup>[33]</sup></a>.”
She required moreover the
Nobility in the several Counties, to provide
themselves, and their Servants and Dependants
in like manner, with Horses and Armour, to
be ready to repair upon Summons to the Queen,
for Defence of her Person: And to this Purpose
Letters were address’d to them from the
Lords of the Council, by her Command.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such were the Directions given. <a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c019'><sup>[34]</sup></a>And accordingly
Cities, Counties, Towns, and Villages,
the Cinque-Ports, and all other Havens
of <i>England</i>, manifested as great Forwardness
in their zealous Love and Duty, as either Subjects
could perform, or Prince expect. The
City of <i>London</i>, in particular, being requested
by the Privy-Council, to find five thousand
Men, and fifteen Ships, they willingly and
cheerfully furnished thirty Ships provided with
all Necessaries, and ten thousand able Men,
well armed and trained; besides which, they
kept in readiness thirty thousand Men more,
prepared to march wherever there should be
Occasion<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c019'><sup>[35]</sup></a>; and also lent the Queen fifty
one thousand nine hundred Pounds, in ready
Money.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, as to the rest of the Nation: <a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c019'><sup>[36]</sup></a>As
soon as it was reported that the Queen was
come near <i>London</i>, and the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet appeared
in the Channel, the greatest Part of
the Nobility, except those that were obliged
to stay in each County on account of their
Offices, repaired to <i>London</i>, to preserve the
Queen’s Person; bringing with them goodly
Bands of Horsemen, about five thousand in
all, and maintaining them at their own Charge
’till the <i>Spanish</i> Navy was known to be passed
beyond <i>Scotland</i>: These were the Lord
Chancellor <i>Hatton</i>, the Earls of <i>Lincoln</i>, <i>Warwick</i>,
<i>Leicester</i>, <i>Essex</i>, <i>Worcester</i>, and <i>Hereford</i>;
the Lord Viscount <i>Montacute</i>; the Lords
<i>Burghley</i>, <i>Compton</i>, <i>Morley</i>, <i>Rich</i>, <i>Dacres</i>,
<i>Windsor</i>, <i>Audley</i>, <i>Sandes</i>, <i>Mordaunt</i>, <i>Lumley</i>,
<i>Mountjoy</i>, <i>Stourton</i>, and <i>Darcy</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a Word, all Persons throughout <i>England</i>
in general, unanimously concurred to be
ready to serve for the Defence of the Queen
and Kingdom<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c019'><sup>[37]</sup></a>: In this there was no Difference
between the Catholic and the Protestant,
but herein appeared a perfect Sympathy, Concourse,
and Consent of all Sorts of Persons,
without respect of Religion. By this hearty
Zeal, seconded with suitable Endeavours, it
came to pass, that some Counties were able to
bring into the Field twenty thousand, and others
even forty thousand able fighting Men:
The Maritime Counties, in particular, on the
South and East of <i>England</i>, from <i>Cornwall</i>
to <i>Lincolnshire</i>, were so well furnished with a
stout and well regulated Militia, that there
was no Place for landing foreign Forces, but
within eight and forty Hours there could resort
to that Place above twenty thousand fighting
Men, with Ordnance and other suitable
Provisions.</p>

<p class='c009'>And that the Popish discontented Party at
home might neither join the Enemy, nor favour
their Descent, the Queen caused the most
obnoxious of them to be imprisoned in <i>Wisbich-Castle</i>
in the Isle of <i>Ely</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>She also directed <a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c019'><sup>[38]</sup></a>Sir <i>William Fitz-Williams</i>,
Lord Deputy of <i>Ireland</i>, what to do,
in case the Enemy should land in any Part of
his Government, and pointed out to him what
Precautions he should use to hinder the <i>Irish</i>
from rising.</p>

<p class='c009'>There remained only the King of <i>Scots</i>, of
whom Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> had most Reason to
be afraid; since she had newly given him an
unpardonable Provocation, namely, in causing
his Mother to be publickly beheaded, who was
a Sovereign Princess, independent of her. This
was sufficient to dispose him, out of a Principle
of Revenge, to favour the Descent of the
<i>Spaniards</i> in one Extremity of the Kingdom,
by making a Diversion in the other. With
that View he had been tampered with by the
Duke of <i>Parma</i>, and had received from him
Offers of Assistance<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c019'><sup>[39]</sup></a>: But the politic Queen
so effectually caress’d him, made him such advantageous
Proposals, and so plainly convinc’d
him, that the Loss of <i>England</i> would not fail
of being attended with that of <i>Scotland</i><a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c019'><sup>[40]</sup></a>; that
he, sensible of the common Danger wherewith
he was threatened, declar’d the <i>Spaniards</i> Enemies,
and made Preparations against them
with great Chearfulness and Alacrity: <a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c019'><sup>[41]</sup></a>Giving
a strict Charge upon all the Sea-Coasts,
that the <i>Spaniards</i> should not be suffered to
land in any Part, but that the <i>English</i> might
land, and be reliev’d of any Wants: <a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c019'><sup>[42]</sup></a>He
moreover offer’d Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> his Forces,
his Person, and all that he could command,
to be employed against the common Enemy:
And he humourously observ’d upon this Occasion<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c019'><sup>[43]</sup></a>,
<i>That he look’d for no other Favour
from the Spaniards, than what</i> Polyphemus <i>promis’d</i>
Ulysses, <i>that he should be reserv’d for the
last Morsel</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_5_0_6 c017'>BOTH Sides being thus fitted out, and
prepared for Action, let us now proceed,</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Thirdly</i>, To give an Account of the Expedition,
and the several Engagements between
the two Fleets, with the final Event of the
whole.</p>

<p class='c009'>The King of <i>Spain</i>’s Instructions to his General,
were<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c019'><sup>[46]</sup></a>, To repair to <i>Calais</i> Road, and
there wait for the Arrival of the Duke of
<i>Parma</i>, who had Orders to join him with his
Fleet and Forces; and, upon their meeting, to
open a Letter directed to them both, with further
Orders [particularly, to advance up the
<i>Thames</i>, and attack <i>London</i>.] He was strictly
enjoined, in the mean time, to sail along the
Coasts of <i>Bretagne</i> and <i>Normandy</i>, in order to
avoid being discovered by the <i>English</i> Fleet;
and if unexpectedly he should meet them, not
to offer Battle, but act only upon the Defensive.</p>

<p class='c009'>With these Instructions, the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet
set sail on the
19<sup>th</sup>
of <i>May</i> from the <i>Tagus</i>,
and steer’d for the <i>Groyne</i>, the Place of general
Rendezvous. But they had not been long
at Sea, before they were so dispersed by a
violent Storm, off of Cape <i>Finisterre</i>, that
scarce the third Part of them reached, some
Days after, the intended Port: And three of
the Gallies, by the Stratagem of <i>David Gwyn</i>,
an <i>English</i> Slave, assisted by some of the
<i>Moorish</i> Rowers, were run into a Harbour of
<i>France</i><a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c019'><sup>[47]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the mean time, the Lord <i>Howard</i> having
continued a good while upon the Narrow
Seas between <i>England</i> and <i>Flanders</i><a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c019'><sup>[48]</sup></a>, sent
Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> towards the Western Coasts,
with about fifty Sail, great and small; intending
to follow himself, with a stronger Force,
if there should be Occasion. For the present
he remained in the <i>Downs</i>, with the Lord
<i>Henry Seymour</i> his Vice-Admiral, where they
had under their Command twenty Ships belonging
to the City of <i>London</i>, with several
other Vessels fitted out by the Coast-Towns,
from the <i>Thames</i> to <i>Newcastle</i>. But News
being brought of the Armada’s being ready
to put to Sea, the Admiral left the Lord
<i>Henry Seymour</i> with a convenient Number of
Ships, to watch the Duke of <i>Parma</i>’s Motions;
and setting Sail on the
21<sup>st</sup>
of <i>May</i>, with about thirty Vessels of all Sorts, arrived
on the
23<sup>d</sup>
 at <i>Plymouth</i>. Here he was joined
by Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>, whom he constituted
his Vice-Admiral, and whose Squadron, by
the Addition of some Vessels from the Western
Ports, amounted now to sixty Sail.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lord <i>Howard</i>, upon his Arrival at
<i>Plymouth</i>, gave Orders for the Victualling, and
putting in Readiness, the whole Fleet, which
now consisted in all of about ninety Ships and
Barks. As soon as it was ready he put out
to Sea, and cruized at the Channel’s Mouth,
between <i>Ushent</i> and <i>Scilly</i>, looking out for the
<i>Spanish</i> Fleet. He thus continued cruizing for
several Days, sometimes upon the Coast of
<i>France</i>, and sometimes upon that of <i>England</i>;
and, at last, hearing nothing of the <i>Spaniards</i>,
returned to <i>Plymouth</i>, for a new Supply of
Victuals, and other Necessaries.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mean while, fourteen <i>Spanish</i> Ships were
discovered between <i>Ushent</i> and <i>Scilly</i>, which
were afterwards known to have been separated
from the rest of the Fleet by the late Storm.
But before they could be met with by any
<i>English</i> Ships, they had a Northerly Wind,
which carried them back to the <i>Groyne</i>; where,
and at the neighbouring Ports, the whole Fleet
took in their Soldiers and Warlike Provisions.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, as has been said above,
had been dispersed, and somewhat disabled by
a violent Storm. This had like to have proved
more fatal to the <i>English</i> than to the <i>Spaniards</i>
themselves<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c019'><sup>[49]</sup></a>. For it being reported all over
<i>Europe</i>, that the whole <i>Spanish</i> Fleet was destroyed,
Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> and her Ministers
thought that it was at least so damaged, as
that it could not proceed ’till the next Year.
Relying therefore upon this Intelligence, which
they took for certain, Secretary <i>Walsingham</i>
signified the Queen’s Pleasure to the Lord
High-Admiral, to send back four of his largest
Ships into Port. His Lordship had, in the
mean time, likewise Intelligences sundry ways,
that the Enemy’s Fleet was dispersed into several
Ports of <i>Spain</i>, distressed, spoiled, in want
of Provisions, and with a great Mortality among
the Men. This, however, happened to
be only a false Rumour. The Lord-Admiral
not thinking it safe to depend upon such Uncertainties,
when the Nation’s All was at Stake,
got the Order countermanded; alledging how
dangerous it was to be too credulous in a matter
of such Importance, and that he would rather
keep the Ships out at his own Charge,
than hazard his Country’s Safety. But, in order
to be fully satisfied, (as he was sure that
the Coasts of <i>England</i> and <i>France</i>, which he
had examined, were clear) he thought proper<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c019'><sup>[50]</sup></a>,
with the Advice of a Council of War, to take
the Opportunity of the first Northerly Wind,
and go in quest of the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, in the
<i>Groyne</i>, and other Ports of <i>Gallicia</i>; and there
utterly destroy it, if it were already so disabled
as was reported; or, if otherwise, to get
certain Intelligence concerning its true State
and Condition. Accordingly his Lordship
made Sail for the Coast of <i>Spain</i>, with a
Northerly Wind, and held the same Course
for about three Days, from the
8<sup>th</sup> to the 10<sup>th</sup>
of <i>July</i>. He was not then above forty Leagues
from that Kingdom, when being informed that
the Enemy’s Fleet was not so much damaged
as reported, and the Wind coming to be Southerly,
he judged it best (as his Instructions
were to guard the <i>English</i> Coasts,) to return
to <i>Plymouth</i>; lest the same Wind should bring
the Enemies out, and carry them by him, unseen,
towards <i>England</i>. He arrived at <i>Plymouth</i>
the
12<sup>th</sup>
of <i>July</i>, and with great Expedition
supplied his Fleet with whatever Necessaries
were wanting.</p>

<p class='c009'>His Caution was indeed very seasonable:
For with the same Southerly Wind the Duke
of <i>Medina Sidonia</i> sailed, with the whole Fleet
under his Command, from the <i>Groyne</i>, on the
12<sup>th</sup>
of <i>July</i>, (the very same Day the Lord
Admiral arrived at <i>Plymouth</i>,) and in two or
three Days detached a Yatch to the Duke of
<i>Parma</i>, with Notice of his being advanced so
far. He pressed him at the same Time, to be
ready with the Troops and Ships he was directed
to provide, in order to pass over into
<i>England</i> under his Convoy, as soon as he
should be arrived in the Streights of <i>Dover</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet lay at the <i>Groyne</i><a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c019'><sup>[51]</sup></a>,
an <i>English</i> Fisherman that was taken and
brought to that Place, gave the Enemies, either
out of Ignorance or Design, this false Account:
“That the <i>English</i> Fleet had lately
been at Sea; but seeing no Prospect of the
<i>Spaniards</i> pursuing their Design that Year,
was returned, and the greater Part of the
Men belonging to the Ships discharged.”
This false Intelligence made the Duke of <i>Medina
Sidonia</i> deviate from his Instructions;
and as he vainly supposed that he could easily
surprise our Fleet, and burn or otherwise
destroy it, he resolved not to lose so glorious
an Opportunity. Instead therefore of going
directly to join the Duke of <i>Parma</i>, a Resolution
was taken in the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, to bend
their Course towards <i>England</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c019'><sup>[52]</sup></a>On the
16<sup>th</sup>
of <i>July</i> there was a Calm
and a thick Fog ’till Noon. Then the North
East Wind blew very strong, and presently
after the West Wind ’till Midnight; and
then the East-South-East Wind; insomuch
that the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet being thereby dispersed,
was hardly joined again ’till it came within
Sight of <i>England</i>. At length this Fleet, after
an indifferent Passage over the Bay of <i>Biscay</i>,
arrived <i>July</i> 19, in Sight of <i>England</i> and entered
the Channel. The first Land they made
was the <i>Lizard</i>, which they took to be the
<i>Ram’s Head</i> near <i>Plymouth</i>; but Night approaching,
they stood off, designing the next
Morning to attack the <i>English</i> Ships in <i>Plymouth</i>
Harbour.</p>

<p class='c009'>The same Day<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c019'><sup>[53]</sup></a>, the Lord Admiral was
informed by Captain <i>Thomas Flemming</i>, Commander
of the <i>Golden Hind</i> Pinnace, who had
been left in the Channel for Discovery, that
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'><a href='#plate-01'>Plate 1</a>.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet was seen near the
<i>Lizard</i>, the Wind being then Southerly,
or South-West. Tho’ the Wind blew
hard into <i>Plymouth-Sound</i>, and the Intelligence
was not received ’till about four o’ Clock in
the Afternoon, yet his Lordship, with much
Diligence and Industry, got out the same Evening
with six of his Ships, and anchored
with them alone the whole Night, without the
Harbour.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c019'><sup>[54]</sup></a>The next Day, <i>July</i> 20, the Lord High-Admiral,
accompanied with fifty four Ships
of his Fleet, that had plied out of the <i>Sound</i>,
notwithstanding the South-West Wind, advanced
towards the Enemy. They were scarce
got as far as the <i>Eddystone</i>, when they discovered,
about Noon, the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet to the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'><a href='#plate-02'>Plate 2</a>.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Westward, opposite to <i>Fowey</i>, in form
of a half Moon (the Points whereof
were about seven Miles asunder) coming slowly
up the Channel, tho’ with full Sails. The
<i>English</i> suffered them to pass by unmolested,
that they might chace them in the rear, with
all the Advantage of the Wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next Morning, <i>July</i> 21, all the <i>English</i>
Ships being then come out of <i>Plymouth</i>,
and in number near a hundred, had recovered
the Wind of the <i>Spaniards</i><a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c019'><sup>[55]</sup></a>, two Leagues to
the Westward of <i>Eddystone</i>. About Nine
o’ Clock, the Lord-Admiral sent his Pinnace,
named the <i>Defiance</i><a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c019'><sup>[56]</sup></a>, to denounce War against
the Enemy, by the Discharge of all her
Guns. He himself immediately seconded her
from his own Ship, the <i>Ark-Royal</i>, by thundering
furiously on one of the Enemy’s, commanded
by <i>Alphonso de Leva</i>, which he mistook
for the <i>St. Martin</i>, the Admiral’s Ship;
but she was, after a smart Engagement,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'><a href='#plate-03'>Plate 3</a>.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>rescued by the <i>Spaniards</i>. In the mean
time, Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>, Captain <i>John Hawkins</i>,
and Captain <i>Martin Forbisher</i>, vigorously
engaged the Enemy’s sternmost Ships, under
the Conduit of their Vice-Admiral <i>Recalde</i>;
in one of which <i>Recalde</i> himself was supposed
to be. He did all that a gallant Officer could
do to keep his Ships together; but the Fight
was so briskly maintained, that, notwithstanding
all his Endeavours, they were forced to
retreat to the main Body of the Fleet; and at
length, his own Ship being very much damaged
with Shot, and grown unserviceable, he
retired thither himself, tho’ with much ado.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this first Engagement <i>Recalde</i>’s Ship lost
fifteen Men<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c019'><sup>[57]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same time, the Duke of <i>Medina</i>
gathered together his Fleet<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c019'><sup>[58]</sup></a>, which was dispersed
about; and hoisting more Sail, held on
his Course with all the Speed he could make.
Nor was it in his Power to do otherwise, seeing
the Wind favoured the <i>English</i>, and their
Ships were so light and nimble, that they
would charge, wind, and tack about with incredible
Swiftness; whereas the <i>Spanish</i> great
and heavy Slugs, stood like so many Butts for
the <i>English</i> Shot. Although the <i>Spaniards</i>
were so briskly charged by the <i>English</i>, they
made a running Fight of it; and, after a smart
Engagement of two Hours, the Lord High-Admiral
thought fit to desist, because forty of
his Ships were not yet come up, being scarce
got out of <i>Plymouth</i> Haven<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c019'><sup>[59]</sup></a>. So not proceeding
any farther, he gave the Signal for a
Council of War;——Wherein his Lordship’s
prudent and considerate Advice being very
much approved, Orders were delivered to each
Captain, in what manner they should pursue
the Enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Night following, one of the <i>Spanish</i>
Ships, called the <i>St. Katherine</i>, having received
much Damage in the Fight, was brought
into the midst of their Fleet, to be repaired<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c019'><sup>[60]</sup></a>.
And a large <i>Biscayan</i> Ship of eight hundred
Tuns, belonging to <i>Michael de Oquendo</i>, Admiral
of the <i>Guypuscoan</i> Squadron, on board
of which was the Treasurer of the Fleet, was
designedly set on Fire by a <i>Dutch</i> Gunner,
who had been ill used<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c019'><sup>[61]</sup></a>; but the <i>Spaniards</i>
took out the best Part of the Money, when
they saw the Ship in Danger; and after
her upper Part was burnt and blown up, the
Flame was extinguished by some Ships that
came seasonably to her Assistance. But one of
them, a great Galleon, commanded by Don
<i>Pedro de Valdez</i>, sprung her Foremast and
Boltsprit, by falling foul of another Vessel in
the Hurry and Confusion; and so, not being
able to keep Company with the rest of the
Fleet, was left behind. The Night being extremely
dark, and the Sea running so high,
that no Succour could come to her, she fell the
next Day, <i>July</i> 22, into the Hands of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'><a href='#plate-04'>Plate 4</a>.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>; who had her conducted
to <i>Dartmouth</i>, and sent the Captain,
and some other Gentlemen who were on board,
Prisoners to <i>Plymouth</i>, where they remained
eighteen Months, ’till their Ransoms were paid.
In this Galleon was found fifty five thousand
Ducats of Gold, which <i>Drake</i>’s Men shared
amongst themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c019'><sup>[62]</sup></a>This Night the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet bore along
by the <i>Start</i>, and the next Morning was as far
to the Leward as the <i>Berry</i><a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c019'><sup>[63]</sup></a>. Sir <i>Francis
Drake</i> had been ordered to carry Lights; but
being in full Chace of some <i>German</i> Hulks,
or Merchant-Men, which he discovered late in
the Evening, and took for Enemies, he happened
to neglect it; which occasioned most of
the Fleet to lye by all Night, because not seeing
the Lights, they knew not whom to follow.
For that Reason, Sir <i>Francis</i>, and the
rest of the Fleet, did not come up ’till the
next Evening with the Lord Admiral; who,
accompanied only with the <i>Bear</i> and the <i>Mary
Rose</i>, had pursued the Enemy, within Culverin
Shot, all the foregoing Night. <a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c019'><sup>[64]</sup></a>Thro’
this Mistake, the rest of the <i>English</i> Fleet staid
so far behind, that the next Morning the nearest
could scarce be seen half Mast high, and
very many were quite out of Sight.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>July</i> 22. This whole Day the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral
spent in disposing his Fleet in the best
Order he could think of. <a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c019'><sup>[65]</sup></a>He commanded
<i>Alphonso de Leva</i> to bring the first and the
last Squadron together; and assigning every
particular Ship its proper Station in Battle, according
to the Plan agreed on in <i>Spain</i>, enjoined
their respective Commanders to keep the
same on Pain of Death. He also dispatch’d
<i>Glich</i>, an Ensign, to the Prince of <i>Parma</i>, to
advise him of his near Approach, and inform
him of the State of the Navy. In the mean
time, the forementioned Ship of <i>Oquendo</i> having
been much damaged by the Fire, the <i>Spanish</i>
Admiral ordered, after the Officers, Men,
and Money were removed into another Vessel,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'><a href='#plate-05'>Plate 5</a>.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>that she should be abandoned, and set
adrift<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c019'><sup>[66]</sup></a>. Whereupon, the Lord High-Admiral
sent the Lord <i>Thomas Howard</i>, and
Captain <i>Hawkins</i> in a small Skiff on board her,
who found her in a very pitiful Condition. Her
Decks were fallen in, the Steerage broken, the
Stern blown out, and about fifty poor Creatures
burnt with Powder in a most miserable manner.
The Stench, as well as the horrible Spectacle,
soon made them return to the Lord-Admiral;
who ordered the Bark <i>Fleming</i> to conduct her
into some Port, and accordingly she was brought
the next Day into <i>Weymouth</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Night following prov’d very calm;
during which, the four Galleasses of <i>Naples</i>
singling themselves from the rest of the Enemy’s
Fleet, gave Reason to suspect that they
had a Design to distress some of the small
<i>English</i> Vessels, which were short of the Fleet;
but their Courage failing them, they attempted
nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the
23<sup>d</sup>
the Wind turning to the North-East,
the <i>Spaniards</i> took the Advantage of it;
and when they came over against <i>Portland</i>,
tacked about upon the <i>English</i>, who presently
tacked likewise, and stood in to the North-West,
towards the Shore, as did the <i>Spaniards</i>
also. But that Course not being good for the
<i>English</i> to recover the Wind of the <i>Spaniards</i>,
the former cast about to the Eastward. And,
after several Attempts on both Sides to get the
Weather-gage, the <i>Spaniards</i> offering to board
the <i>English</i>, a smart Engagement began, which
was managed with Confusion enough, and with
Variety of Success. The Enemy seeing several
of the <i>English</i> Ships waited their coming,
particularly the <i>Ark</i>, the <i>Nonpareil</i>, the <i>Elizabeth-Jonas</i>,
the <i>Victory</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> they fell a stern
the <i>Nonpareil</i>, which was the hindmost Ship;
and in the mean time, the <i>Triumph</i>, with the
<i>Merchant-Royal</i>, the <i>Centurion</i>, the <i>Margaret</i>
and <i>John</i>, the <i>Mary-Rose</i>, and the <i>Golden-Lion</i>,
were so far to the Leeward, and at such a
Distance from the rest of the Fleet, that the
Galleasses took Courage, and bearing down
upon them, attacked them very vigorously; but
they gave them a warm Reception for an Hour
and a half, ’till some of her Majesty’s Ships
came to their Relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Wind then shifted to the South-East,
and afterwards to the South-South-West;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'><a href='#plate-06'>Plate 6</a>.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>whereupon a Body of <i>English</i> Ships,
and several Merchant-Men attacked the
<i>Spanish</i> Fleet so sharply to the Westward,
that it was all forced to give way. The Lord-Admiral
perceiving this, and observing at the
same Time the Distress which the <i>Triumph</i> and
the five Ships above mentioned in her Company,
were in, he ordered some Ships that were
then near at hand, to follow him, and to set
upon the <i>Spaniards</i> a-fresh; and he strictly
charged them, to go within Musket-Shot of
the Enemy, before they discharged any one
Piece of Ordnance, that they might have a
better Mark, and more effectually succour the
<i>Triumph</i>. This was immediately performed by
the <i>Ark</i>, the <i>Elizabeth-Jonas</i>, the Galleon of
<i>Leicester</i>, the <i>Golden Lion</i>, the <i>Victory</i>, the
<i>Mary Rose</i>, the <i>Dreadnought</i>, and the <i>Swallow</i>;
for in that order they proceeded. The
Duke of <i>Medina</i> perceiving their Design, came
out with sixteen of his best Galleons, to intercept
the Lord Admiral, and stop him from
assisting the <i>Triumph</i>. But, after a very sharp
Conflict, the <i>Spaniards</i> were forced to give
way, and for their greater Safety to gather
themselves close into a Roundel, their best and
largest Ships standing outermost, and fencing
the lesser and the most battered. In this Conflict,
<i>William Coxe</i>, Captain of a small Pinnace
of Sir <i>William Winter</i>’s, nam’d the <i>Delight</i>,
was slain by a great Shot, while he was bravely
fighting against the Enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Towards the Evening, four or five of the
<i>Spanish</i> Vessels edged out of the South-Westward,
where they were met by some of our
Ships; amongst which, the <i>May-Flower of
London</i> valiantly discharged some Pieces of Cannon
at them; and, on this and other Occasions,
that Ship’s Company behaved with great Resolution
and Courage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus the Fight continued from Morning till
Night, being managed with great Bravery; but
the <i>Spaniards</i> Shot flew, for the most part, over
the Heads of the <i>English</i>, without doing
Execution<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c019'><sup>[67]</sup></a>; the reason of which was, that
the <i>English</i> Ships being far less than the Enemy’s,
made the Attack with more Quickness
and Agility; and when they had given a
Broad-Side, sheer’d off to a convenient Distance;
and levell’d their Shot so directly at
the larger and more unwieldy Ships of the <i>Spaniards</i>,
as seldom to miss their Aim. Some
advis’d the Lord-Admiral, with more Heat
than Discretion, to grapple with and board
them; but he thought it neither safe nor convenient;
because the Enemy’s Fleet had a considerable
Army on board, whereas ours had no
such Advantage; besides their Ships far exceeded
the <i>English</i> in Number and Bulk, and
were much stronger and higher built; insomuch
that their Men having the Opportunity
to ply the others from such lofty Decks, must
inevitably have destroyed those that were obliged,
as it were, to fight beneath them. And
he foresaw likewise, that the Damage and Disgrace
of a total Defeat would much outweigh
the Advantage of a Victory, should he happen
to obtain it; since, if he was vanquished, it
would have much endangered the Safety of the
whole Kingdom; but if he got the better, he
could obtain no more than the naked Credit
of putting a Fleet in Disorder, and baffling an
Enemy.——In this Day’s Engagement, a great
<i>Venetian</i> Ship, with several other smaller ones
were taken by the <i>English</i><a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c019'><sup>[68]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the
24<sup>th</sup>
of <i>July</i>, there was but little
done<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c019'><sup>[69]</sup></a>; the Fight being only between four
great Galleasses and some <i>English</i> Vessels<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c019'><sup>[70]</sup></a>.
The <i>Spaniards</i>, upon this Occasion had great
Advantage, since their Ships had Oars, and
ours, by reason of a Calm, had no use of
their Sails. However, the <i>English</i> galled the
Enemy very much with their Cannon and
Chain-Shot; but at last, wanting Powder and
other Necessaries to continue the Fight, the
Lord Admiral sent some Vessels into the next
Port for a Supply. In the mean time, a Council
of War was held, wherein it was agreed,
That the Fleet should be divided into four
Squadrons, to be commanded, the first by the
Lord Admiral himself in the <i>Ark-Royal</i>; the
second by Sir <i>Francis Drake</i> in the <i>Revenge</i>;
the third by Captain <i>Hawkins</i>; and the fourth
by Captain <i>Forbisher</i>. <a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c019'><sup>[71]</sup></a>This Afternoon, his
Lordship gave order, that in the Night, six
Merchant-Ships out of every Squadron (as being
the lightest) should set upon the <i>Spanish</i>
Fleet in several Places at once; but it being
calm all that Night, nothing could be done.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next Morning, <i>July 25</i>, both
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'><a href='#plate-07'>Plate 7</a>.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Fleets being come over against the Isle
of <i>Wight</i>, (which the <i>Spaniards</i> had resolved
to make themselves Masters of,) and not above
a hundred Yards asunder, a terrible Fight began<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c019'><sup>[72]</sup></a>.
The <i>St. Ann</i>, a large <i>Portuguese</i> Galleon,
being short of the rest to the Southward,
because not able to keep up with them, was
attack’d by some of Captain <i>Hawkins</i>’s Squadron,
which stood next to it; who causing
themselves to be towed along, attempted to
board her, and went so close, that their Boats
were beaten off with Musket-Shot: <i>Leva</i> and
Don <i>Diego Telles Enriques</i> perceiving the Galleon’s
Danger, issued out of the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet
with three Galleasses, and endeavoured to rescue
her; but they were so warmly received by
the Lord Admiral himself, and the Lord <i>Thomas
Howard</i> in the <i>Golden Lion</i>, who, by
reason of the Calm, had their Ships tow’d along
with Boats, that the Galleon was got off
with much Difficulty, and not without Loss;
for one of the Galleasses was forc’d to be carried
away upon the Careen; another, by a
Shot from the <i>Ark</i>, lost her Lanthorn; and
the third her Peak-head. Thus many Shots
were interchanged between the <i>Ark</i> and <i>Lion</i>
and the Galleasses, in Sight of both Fleets,
which looked on, and could not come near by
reason of the Calm. At length it began to
blow a small Gale, whereupon the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet
edged up to succour their Galleasses, and so
rescued them; but so roughly were the Galleasses
handled, that after this none of them
would venture upon any new Engagement.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c019'><sup>[73]</sup></a>Then the Fleets drawing near one another
the Fight was renewed; but it did not continue
long; except that the <i>Nonpareil</i> and the
<i>Mary Rose</i> were for some time engaged with
the Enemy, and striking their Topsails, lay a
while by, and braved the whole Fleet of <i>Spain</i>.
In the mean while, the <i>Triumph</i>, to the Northward
of the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, was so far to Leward,
that being apprehensive some of the Enemy
might weather her, she towed off with
the Help of several Boats, and so recovered the
Wind. The <i>Bear</i> and the <i>Elizabeth Jonas</i>
perceiving her in Distress, bore down to rescue
her, and by their Boldness put themselves into
the like Danger; but they, however, made
their party good, ’till they had recovered the
Wind. And thus ended this Day’s Fight,
which was very sharp for the time.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c019'><sup>[74]</sup></a>The <i>Spaniards</i> gave a different Account
of this Day’s Engagement; for they said that
the <i>English</i> did miserably batter, with their
great Guns, the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral, who lay in
the rear; came so near him as to kill many of
his Men; brought his Mainmast by the board;
and he was in great Danger of being lost, had
not <i>Mexia</i> and <i>Recalde</i> come timely to his Assistance;
but that, after this, the <i>Spanish</i> Admiral
and his Men, seconded by <i>Recalde</i>, and
others, set upon the <i>English</i> Admiral, who by
the turning of the Wind happily escaped; that
the <i>Spaniards</i> from that time gave over the
Chace, and keeping on their Course, dispatch’d
a Messenger to the Duke of <i>Parma</i>, to desire
him to come and join the Armada with his
own Squadron as soon as possible; and to send
them withal some great Shot for the use of the
main Fleet.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c019'><sup>[75]</sup></a>However it be, the <i>English</i> had so battered
the Enemy in the last Conflict, that the
latter had Recourse to the Form of a Roundel
for their better Security.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c019'><sup>[76]</sup></a>On <i>Friday, July 26</i>, the Lord High-Admiral
sent for the Lord <i>Thomas Howard</i> the
Lord <i>Sheffield</i>, <i>Roger Townshend</i>, Captain <i>Martin Forbisher</i>,
Captain <i>John Hawkins</i>, on board
his own Ship the <i>Ark</i>; and there confer’d on
them the Honour of Knighthood, as well for
a Reward of their good Services in the late
Engagement, as for an Encouragement to the
rest of the Officers.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c019'><sup>[77]</sup></a>Next, a Council of War being held, it
was determined, as our Ships began to want
Powder and Shot, that they should not attack
the <i>Spaniards</i> again ’till they came to the
Streights of <i>Calais</i>; because they would there
be joined and reinforced by the Squadron under
the Command of the Lord <i>Henry Seymour</i>
and Sir <i>William Winter</i>, stationed in those
Parts to block up the Duke of <i>Parma</i>; and
might, at the same time, receive a plentiful
Store of Ammunition from our Coasts.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c019'><sup>[78]</sup></a>So the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet sailed forward,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'><a href='#plate-08'>Plate 8</a>.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>this and the best part of the next Day,
with a gentle Gale at South-West and by
South, the <i>English</i> following them close, and
driving them like Sheep before them; and so
far was this Invincible Armada from alarming
the Sea-Coasts with any frightful Apprehensions,
that a great many of the young Nobility
and Gentry entered themselves Volunteers, and
taking leave of their Parents, Wives, and Children,
did, with incredible Chearfulness, hire
Ships at their own Charge; and, in pure Love
to their Country, joined the Grand Fleet in
vast numbers: <a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c019'><sup>[79]</sup></a>Among which were, the Earls
of <i>Oxford</i>, <i>Northumberland</i>, and <i>Cumberland</i>;
the Lord <i>Dudley</i>; Sir <i>Thomas</i>, Sir <i>Robert</i>, and
<i>William Cecil</i>; Sir <i>Henry Brooke</i>, Sir <i>William
Hatton</i>, Sir <i>Charles Blount</i>, Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i>,
Sir <i>Robert Carey</i>, Sir <i>Ambrose Willoughby</i>,
Sir <i>Thomas Vavasor</i>, Sir <i>Horatio Pallavicini</i>;
<i>Thomas Gerard</i>, <i>Henry Nowel</i>, <i>Edward
Darcy</i>, <i>Thomas Woodhouse</i>, <i>William Harvey</i>,
<i>Arthur Gorges</i>, and others; <a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c019'><sup>[80]</sup></a>and at the same
time, the Justices of Peace in the maritime
Counties, as also the Earl of <i>Sussex</i>, Sir <i>George
Carey</i>, and the Captains of the Forts and Castles
along the Sea-Coasts, sent Ships, Men,
Powder, Shot, Victuals, and all kinds of Provisions,
for the Relief and Assistance of the
main Fleet.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c019'><sup>[81]</sup></a><i>July 27.</i> This Day, towards the Evening,
the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet came to an Anchor before
<i>Calais</i>; <a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c019'><sup>[82]</sup></a>intending for <i>Dunkirk</i>, where
they were to join the Prince of <i>Parma</i>’s Forces;
<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c019'><sup>[83]</sup></a>but their Pilots having told them, that,
if they ventured any farther, they should be in
danger of being carried away by the Force of
the Tide into the Northern Channel, for that
Reason they proceeded no farther than <i>Calais</i>;
the <i>English</i>, on their part, followed them close,
and anchored within Culverin-Shot of them;
and, by the accession of the Ships under the
Lord <i>Henry Seymour</i> and Sir <i>William Winter</i>,
consisted now of a hundred and forty Sail, all
stout Ships, and nimble and good Sailors; tho’
the main Brunt of the Engagement lay but
upon fifteen or sixteen of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Spaniards</i> now sent several Messengers,
one after another, to the Duke of <i>Parma</i>, to
press and importune him to send out forty Fly-Boats
to their Assistance; without which, by
reason of the Unwieldiness of their Ships, they
could not, as they said, engage the light and
active Vessels of the <i>English</i>; they entreated
him likewise, with great Earnestness, to use all
Speed in embarking his Army, and be ready
to take the first Opportunity, under their Protection,
of landing in <i>England</i>; but it seems
he was not ready, and so could not answer
their Summons; his flat-bottom’d Boats were
all leaky, his Provisions not yet all brought in,
and his Sailors, who had been hitherto kept
together against their Wills, had deserted in
great numbers; besides, thirty five Men of
War belonging to <i>Holland</i> and <i>Zealand</i>, commanded
by Count <i>Justin de Nassau</i>, continued
to block up the very Mouth of the Harbours
of <i>Dunkirk</i> and <i>Nieuport</i>, from whence alone
he could put to Sea; and so well were they
furnished with great Guns and small Arms,
that he could not possibly put from Shore,
without running a very great and manifest
Danger; however, intending as soon as he conveniently
could, to join the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, he
sent a Pinnace to inform the Duke of <i>Medina</i>,
“<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c019'><sup>[84]</sup></a>That he could not be ready for them ’till
the <i>Friday</i> following, <i>September 4</i>;” but the
<i>Spanish</i> Fleet was forced to depart before that
time, in the utmost Hurry and Confusion.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c019'><sup>[85]</sup></a>For, on <i>July 28</i>, the next Day
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'><a href='#plate-09'>Plate 9</a>.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>after their coming to an Anchor, the
Lord Admiral, by the Queen’s express Command
and Direction, singled out eight of his
worst Ships; bestowed upon them good Plenty
of Pitch, Tar, Rosin, and Wildfire; lined them
well with Brimstone and other combustible Matter;
and loaded all their Cannon with Bullets,
Chains, and the like destructive Instruments;
thus equip’d, he sent them with the Wind and
Tide, about two o’ Clock in the Morning,
into the midst of the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, under the
Conduct of —— <i>Young</i> and —— <i>Prowse</i>; who
when they were come within Cannon-Shot, set
Fire to the Trains, and then retired. The Approach
of these Fire-Ships, and the dreadful
Blaze which the Fire made all the Sea over,
was no sooner perceived by the <i>Spaniards</i>, but
it put their whole Fleet into the utmost Consternation.
Many of the Soldiers on board had
been at the Siege of <i>Antwerp</i><a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c019'><sup>[86]</sup></a>, and seen the
destructive Machines made use of there: Suspecting
therefore that these were big with other
Engines of Slaughter, besides the destructive
Element that show’d itself without, they began
to raise a most hideous Clamour of, <i>Cut your
Cables, or get up your Anchors</i>; <a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c019'><sup>[87]</sup></a>and in a
panic Fright put to Sea with all the Confusion
and Precipitancy imaginable.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c019'><sup>[88]</sup></a>The <i>Spaniards</i> reported, however, That
their Admiral, upon the Approach of the Fire-Ships,
made the Signal for weighing Anchor,
and standing out to Sea; and ordered that
each Ship, after the Danger was over, should
return to her Station; that he did return himself,
and fired a Gun as a Signal for the rest
to do the like; but the Report thereof was
heard but by few; because their Fears had so
dispersed them, that some were got a considerable
way out to Sea, and others among the
Shoals on the Coast of <i>Flanders</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>However it was, the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet being by
this successful Stratagem thus driven from their
Station in <i>Calais-Road</i><a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c019'><sup>[89]</sup></a>, another very sharp
Engagement began the next Morning about
Eight o’ Clock, <i>July 29</i>, and continued eight
Hours. The chief Galleass, commanded by
<i>Hugo de Moncada</i>, having in the last Night’s
Confusion lost her Rudder, by falling foul of
another Ship’s Cable, and floated up and down
for some time before the Wind, endeavoured
to save herself by rowing into
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'><a href='#plate-10'>Plate 10</a>.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span><i>Calais</i> Harbour;
which the Lord Admiral perceiving,
he dispatch’d Mr. <i>Amias Preston</i>, one
of his Lieutenants, into his Long-Boat, with
Mr. <i>Thomas Gerrard</i>, Mr. <i>William Hervey</i>,
and others, to take her; she did not however
surrender ’till after a sharp and doubtful Dispute,
wherein <i>Hugo de Moncada</i> was killed,
by a Shot in the Head; and the Soldiers and
Rowers to the number of four hundred, either
drowned or put to the Sword: <a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c019'><sup>[90]</sup></a>The Ship
and Guns, after the <i>English</i> had freed three
hundred Galley-Slaves which were on board,
and taken out fifty thousand Ducats of Gold,
of the King of <i>Spain</i>’s Money, fell, as a
Wreck to Monsieur <i>Gourden</i>, Governor of
<i>Calais</i><a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c019'><sup>[91]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c019'><sup>[92]</sup></a>In the taking of this Galleass, Mr. <i>Gerard</i>
and Mr. <i>Harvey</i> signalized themselves;
for they entered it only with their Swords; a
thing then commonly spoken of with Admiration,
the like having never been hazarded before,
considering the Height of this Galleass
compar’d to a Ship’s Boat.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c019'><sup>[93]</sup></a>The rest of the <i>Spaniards</i> in the mean
time, managed their Fleet as well as they could,
and stood over against <i>Graveling</i>, where the
<i>English</i> once more getting the Weather-Gage
of them, deprived them of the Conveniency of
<i>Calais-Road</i>, and kept them from receiving any
Supplies from <i>Dunkirk</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c019'><sup>[94]</sup></a>Whilst the Lord Admiral was employed
in taking the forementioned Galleass, Sir <i>Francis
Drake</i> in the <i>Revenge</i>, with Mr. <i>Thomas
Fennar</i> in the <i>Nonpareil</i>, and the rest of his
Squadron, warmly engaged the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet;
soon after Sir <i>John Hawkins</i> in the <i>Victory</i>,
accompanied with Mr. <i>Edward Fenton</i> in the
<i>Mary Rose</i>, Sir <i>George Beeston</i> in the <i>Dreadnought</i>,
Mr. <i>Richard Hawkins</i> in the <i>Swallow</i>,
and the rest of that Squadron; together with
Sir <i>Robert Southwell</i> in the <i>Elizabeth-Jonas</i>,
and Mr. <i>Robert Cross</i> in the <i>Hope</i>; bearing up
with the Middle of the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, there
continued all that Forenoon a furious Engagement,
wherein Sir <i>George Beeston</i> behaved himself
very valiantly; they were in the mean
time seconded by the Lord Admiral, the Lord
<i>Thomas Howard</i>, and the Lord <i>Sheffield</i>, who
also acquitted themselves very bravely: Astern
of these a great Galleon was attack’d by the
Earl of <i>Cumberland</i> and Mr. <i>George Ryman</i> in
the <i>Bonaventure</i>, and was likewise battered by
the Lord <i>Henry Seymour</i> in the <i>Rainbow</i>, and
Sir <i>William Winter</i> in the <i>Vanguard</i>; and
tho’ she then recovered the Fleet, yet she sunk
the Night following.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c019'><sup>[95]</sup></a>On the other hand, the Duke of <i>Medina</i>,
with the rest of the <i>Spanish</i> Captains, as <i>Leva</i>,
<i>Oquendo</i>, <i>Recalde</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> having with much ado
got clear of the Shallows, were forced to stand
the Brunt of the <i>English</i> Fire, ’till they were
miserably torn, and in several Places shot
through; <a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c019'><sup>[96]</sup></a>and a great Galleon of <i>Biscay</i>, of
five hundred Tuns, with two Saicks, were sunk.
The Galleon <i>St. Matthew</i>, of eight hundred
Tuns, commanded by Don <i>Diego de Piementelli</i>,
coming to the Assistance of Don <i>Francisco
de Toledo</i>, in the <i>St. Philip</i>, another Galleon
of seven hundred Tuns, they were both
miserably shattered by the Lord <i>Henry Seymour</i>
and Sir <i>William Winter</i>; <a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c019'><sup>[97]</sup></a>and being driven
on the Coast of <i>Ostend</i>, were likewise there
roughly handled by the <i>Zealanders</i>; but <i>Piementelli</i>
refusing to leave his Ship, (though the
Duke of <i>Medina</i> sent him his own,) did all he
could to disengage himself; and therefore making
towards the Coast of <i>Flanders</i>, he was
there again attacked by five <i>Dutch</i> Men of
War, and forc’d at last to strike to <i>Peter
Dousa</i><a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c019'><sup>[98]</sup></a>, one of the <i>Dutch</i> Captains, who carried
him into <i>Zealand</i> and, for a Trophy of
his Victory, hung his Flag in the Church of
<i>Leyden</i>, which reach’d from the top of it to
the bottom; <a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c019'><sup>[99]</sup></a>during which, a <i>Castilian</i> Ship
of four hundred Tuns, was cast away on the
<i>Flemish</i> Coast. The <i>St. Philip</i>, after having
been driven almost as far as <i>Ostend</i>, where her
Commander left her because she proved extremely
leaky, was seized by some Ships of
<i>Flushing</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus did the Fight continue for the best
part of this whole Day; during which the <i>Spanish</i>
Fleet was closely pursued, extremely battered,
and reduced to the utmost Distress<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c019'><sup>[100]</sup></a>.
The <i>English</i> Commanders in general, shewed
on all Occasions great Resolution and Bravery;
and in this last Action, the Earl of <i>Cumberland</i>,
the Lords <i>Henry Seymour</i>, <i>Thomas Howard</i>,
and <i>Edmund Sheffield</i>; Sir <i>William Winter</i>,
Sir <i>Robert Southwell</i>, Sir <i>George Beeston</i>,
Sir <i>John Hawkins</i>; and the Captains <i>Edward
Fenton</i>, <i>Richard Hawkins</i>, <i>George Ryman</i>, and
<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c019'><sup>[101]</sup></a><i>Robert Cross</i> signalized themselves in a remarkable
manner; the latter, in particular,
sunk the great Galleon of <i>Biscay</i> above mentioned,
and two other Vessels. As for the
<i>Spaniards</i>, though some of them performed
their Duty, and fought with great Bravery,
yet, in general, they acted but faintly, and
stood for the most part only upon the defensive,
especially after they saw themselves disappointed
of the Duke of <i>Parma</i>’s Assistance.
“The Duke of <i>Medina</i>, we are told<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c019'><sup>[102]</sup></a>, to his
Dishonour, was lodged in the Bottom of his
Ship for his Safety, and the rest of the
Commanders would never turn their Ships,
nor stop them, to defend any of their own
Friends that were forced to tarry behind,
but suffered divers to perish; and so fearful
was the Admiral, that if the <i>English</i> had
offered to board the <i>Spanish</i> Ships, it was
thought they would have yielded without
making any Resistance.” <a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c019'><sup>[103]</sup></a>In this last Engagement
the <i>Spaniards</i> lost five thousand
Men, a thousand whereof were drowned<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c019'><sup>[104]</sup></a>;
and the next Day two <i>Venetian</i> Ships sunk,
having eight hundred and forty three Men on
board, which all perished.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c019'><sup>[105]</sup></a>After this Fight there remained of the
whole <i>Spanish</i>; Fleet but one hundred and ten,
or one hundred and twelve Ships, and those
extremely battered and shot through, and having
their Rigging much damaged with the
Shot.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c019'><sup>[106]</sup></a>The next Day, <i>July 30</i>, the Lord Admiral
ordered the Lord <i>Henry Seymour</i>, and
Sir <i>William Winter</i> to return back with their
Squadron into the narrow Seas, to guard the
Coasts; as for himself, he resolved to follow
the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet, ’till they came as far Northward
as the <i>Forth</i> in <i>Scotland</i>, if they bent
their Course that way; and, in the mean time,
he thought it best not to attack them any
more, ’till he saw what they proposed to do:
However, being persuaded that they intended
to put into the Firth of <i>Forth</i>, his Lordship
had devised Stratagems, and taken Measures to
make an utter End of them there.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c019'><sup>[107]</sup></a><i>July 31.</i> This Day the <i>Spaniards</i> would
fain have retreated, early in the Morning, thro’
the Streights of <i>Dover</i>; but the Wind coming
up with hard Gales at North West, forced
them towards the Coast of <i>Zealand</i>; the <i>English</i>
then gave over the Chace, because they
perceived them hastening fast enough to their
own Destruction; for with the Wind at West
North-West, they could not fail of being driven
among the Shallows and Sands of that Coast:
But the Wind soon happening to come about
to the South-West and by West, the <i>Spaniards</i>
tacked, and sailing before the Wind, got out of
Danger. In the Evening, they held a Council
of War, wherein it was unanimously resolved<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c019'><sup>[108]</sup></a>,
That seeing they were in want of many Necessaries,
especially of Cannon-Ball, that the
Ships were very much shattered, their Anchors
left in <i>Calais-Road</i>, their Provisions short, their
Water spent, a great number of their Soldiers
slain, many of their Men sick and wounded,
and that there was no hopes of the Duke of
<i>Parma</i>’s coming out to join them, they should
return to <i>Spain</i>, by the North of <i>Scotland</i>.
Pursuant to this Resolution, being now out of
Danger, and in the main Ocean, and having
thrown all their Horses and Mules over board
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'><a href='#chart-00'>General Chart</a>.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>to save Water,
they steer’d Northward,
and the <i>English</i> renew’d the
Chace after them; now and then the <i>Spanish</i>
Ships slacken’d their Sails, and seem’d to stay
for the coming up of the <i>English</i>, so that it
was generally thought their Fleet would tack
about, but they thought best, after all, to keep
on their Course Northward.</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c009'>Here it will not be improper to leave them

<p class='c009'>The
9<sup>th</sup>
of <i>August</i> Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> was
pleased, in order both to comfort her People,
and to shew her own Magnanimity, to come
and view her Army and Camp at <i>Tilbury</i>;
the next Morning after her Arrival, she rode
with a General’s Truncheon in her Hand,
thro’ all the Ranks of the Army, like armed
<i>Pallas</i>, attended by the Earls of <i>Leicester</i> and
<i>Essex</i>, <i>Henry Norris</i>, Lord Marshall, and others;
having the Sword carried before her by

received him in a very reproachful manner;
as if, out of some By-Regards to Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>,
he had designedly slipt so fair an Opportunity
of doing Wonders for the Service of
his Country. The Duke, to appease this
Storm, punish’d those who had the Charge of
Victualling his Fleet; but, however, he did
not attempt to put to Sea, being still block’d
up by the Lord <i>Henry Seymour</i>’s and Sir <i>William
Winter</i>’s Squadron, which were returned
from the Chace. In the mean time, he could
not but secretly laugh at the saucy and insolent
Brags of the <i>Spaniards</i>, whom he had
heard talking at this vain rate, “That where ever
they turn’d their Sails, a most certain
Victory waited upon their Course, and that
the <i>English</i> would not have Courage enough
to look them in the Face.”</p>

<hr class='c020' />

<p class='c009'>To return now to the two Fleets. We left
the <i>Spaniards</i> sailing Northward, and the <i>English</i>
in Pursuit of them: <a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c019'><sup>[116]</sup></a>When the latter
were come to fifty five Degrees thirteen Minutes
North Latitude, and thirty Leagues East
of <i>Newcastle</i>, the Lord High Admiral determined
to attack the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet again on the
<i>Friday</i> following, <i>August 2</i>, but he thought
fit to alter his Resolution, chiefly upon these
two Accounts: Because he plainly perceived
by the Enemies Course, that they had no other
Intention but to save themselves, by sailing
North, round the <i>British</i> Islands; and, because
several of his Ships wanted Victuals and
other Necessaries; which was not so much
owing to any Neglect, as to the Victuallers
not knowing where to send to the Fleet; for
the Queen had most amply and carefully provided
whatever was convenient and necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was therefore concluded, to leave the <i>Spanish</i>
Fleet to pursue their Course, and to sail
for the Firth of <i>Forth</i>; both to get Refreshment,
and to perform some other Business
which the Lord Admiral thought necessary to
be done; but the Wind coming contrary, that
is Westerly, the next Day his Lordship altered
his Course, and sending only some Advice-Boats
to observe the Enemies farther Motion,
he returned with the whole Fleet back to
<i>England</i>, where they arrived, some at <i>Yarmouth</i>,
some at <i>Harwich</i>, and others at the
<i>Downs</i>, about the
7<sup>th</sup>
of <i>August</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <i>Spaniards</i> being now got clear of their
troublesome Pursuers, resolv’d to make the best
of their way for <i>Spain</i>. <a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c019'><sup>[117]</sup></a>Some Suspicions
there were, that they design’d to betake themselves
to the King of <i>Scots</i>, who was provok’d
to an high degree for his Mother’s Death; and
therefore, the better to keep him in Temper,
<i>Ashby</i>, the Queen of <i>England</i>’s Ambassador
in <i>Scotland</i>, made him very considerable Offers,
which, however, were not performed:
But the <i>Spaniards</i> having now laid aside all
Thoughts and Hopes of returning to attack
the <i>English</i>; and perceiving their main Safety
lay in their Flight, they made no Stop at any
Port whatever. <a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c019'><sup>[118]</sup></a>About twenty five Ships
now remain’d with the Duke of <i>Medina</i>, and
forty with <i>Recalde</i>; <a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c019'><sup>[119]</sup></a>these, with the rest of
the Fleet, sail’d about <i>Cathness</i> for the Coast
of <i>Ireland</i>, and pass’d between the <i>Orcades</i>
and <i>Fair-Isle</i>, to the sixty first Degree of
North Latitude; <a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c019'><sup>[120]</sup></a>an unaccustom’d Place for
the young Gallants of <i>Spain</i>, that had never
felt Storms on the Sea, or cold Weather in
<i>August</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c019'><sup>[121]</sup></a>When the <i>English</i> left off pursuing the
<i>Spaniards</i>, the latter wanted of their whole
Fleet fifteen or sixteen Ships; and had lost, in
the several Engagements, and by Sickness, eight
thousand Men at least.</p>

<p class='c009'>And here their ill Fortune did not stop, but
continued to persecute them all the rest of
their Voyage; <a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c019'><sup>[122]</sup></a>for on the Coast of <i>Scotland</i>
they lost the two following Ships, which had
been so extremely battered by the <i>English</i> Shot,
that they founder’d at Sea; namely, the <i>St.
Matthew</i>, a Ship of five hundred Tuns, in
which four hundred and fifty Men were drowned;
and a Biscainer of <i>St. Sebastian’s</i>, of four
hundred Tuns, in which three hundred and
fifty Men perished: <a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c019'><sup>[123]</sup></a>Moreover, in these or
other Ships, above seven hundred Soldiers were
cast on Shore in <i>Scotland</i>, who, by the Duke
of <i>Parma</i>’s Mediation with the King of <i>Scots</i>,
and with Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Permission, were
sent over, a Year after, into the <i>Low-Countries</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c019'><sup>[124]</sup></a>About four Days after the <i>English</i> Fleet
left the <i>Spaniards</i>, they came to an Island in
the North Part of <i>Scotland</i>, where they staid
not, nor had any Relief: And at this Place
the Duke of <i>Medina</i> calling all the Ships together,
charged them to make the best of their
way for the Coasts of <i>Spain</i> or <i>Portugal</i>, because
they were in the utmost Distress for want
of Victuals and other Provisions.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c019'><sup>[125]</sup></a>For an Addition to their Misfortunes, about
the
23<sup>d</sup>
of <i>August</i>, when there were seventy
eight Ships of them together sailing in
the Ocean, a violent Storm arose at South-South-West,
which continued from Four o’
Clock in the Afternoon ’till Ten the next
Morning, and separated them so, that not above
twenty seven of them were to be seen together:
And again, on the
2<sup>d</sup>
of <i>September</i>,
they had another violent Storm, with a Mist,
which so dispersed them, that of the foresaid
twenty seven, only three came together into
<i>Dingle-Bay</i>; <a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c019'><sup>[126]</sup></a>and during their Passage round
the North of <i>Scotland</i>, they had so terrible a
Sickness, that their Mariners and Soldiers died
daily in great Multitudes.</p>

and Men drowned, killed, and taken upon the
Coast of <i>Ireland</i>, during the Month of <i>September</i>,

<i>September</i> the
8<sup>th</sup>
being another and chief
Thanksgiving Day, the Preacher at St. <i>Paul</i>’s
Cross moved the People to give Thanks for
their Enemies Overthrow; and at the same
time were set upon the lower Battlements of
the Church, eleven Ensigns or Banners taken
from the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet; one Streamer in particular,
on which was represented the Virgin
<i>Mary</i> with her Son in her Arms, was held in
a Man’s Hand over the Pulpit: These Banners
were afterwards carried to the Cross in <i>Cheapside</i><a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c019'><sup>[141]</sup></a>;
and the next Day, <i>September 9</i>, were
hanged on <i>London-Bridge</i> towards <i>Southwark</i>,
where the Fair was kept. The
17<sup>th</sup>
of <i>November</i>,
being <i>Sunday</i>, was another Rejoicing-Day,
as well upon account of the Queen’s
Accession to the Throne, as for this Victory.
Her Majesty intended to have been at <i>Paul</i>’s
Cross, to hear a Sermon preach’d by Dr. <i>Cooper</i>
Bishop of <i>Winchester</i>, and Provision had
accordingly been made for her Reception; but
upon some Occasion or other, her coming was
put off ’till the <i>Sunday</i> following: The
19<sup>th</sup>
being <i>Tuesday</i> was a general Thanksgiving-Day
throughout the whole Kingdom. The next
<i>Sunday, November 24</i>, the Queen, attended
by her Privy Council, by the Nobility, and
other honourable Persons, as well Spiritual as
Temporal, in great number, the <i>French</i> Ambassador,
the Judges, the Heralds, and Trumpeters
all on Horseback, came in a Chariot
supported by four Pillars, and drawn by two
white Horses, to St. <i>Paul</i>’s Church; where alighting
at the West Door, she fell on her
Knees, and audibly praised <span class='sc'>God</span> for her own
and the Nation’s signal Deliverance; and, after
a Sermon suitable to the Occasion, preached
by Dr. <i>Pierce</i>, Bishop of <i>Sarum</i>, she exhorted
the People in a most Royal and Christian manner,
to a due Performance of the religious Duty
of Thanksgiving; then going to the Bishop of
<i>London</i>’s Palace, where she dined, she returned
in the same Order as before, by Torch-light,
to <i>Somerset-House</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those brave Men that had ventur’d their
Lives in the Defence of their Country, were
considered and rewarded by the Queen. <a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c019'><sup>[142]</sup></a>She
settled a Pension on the Lord High-Admiral
for his great Service, and bestow’d a handsome
yearly Allowance on the poor and disabled
Seamen; and upon all Occasions she distinguish’d
the rest of the Officers, Soldiers, and
Sailors with particular Marks of her Regard
and Esteem; but their Rewards consisted generally
more in Words than in Deeds.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>NOTE.</h3>
<p class='c021'>The Spanish Armada made an effort, July 25, 1588, to land and take
possession of the Isle of Wight, when a spirited engagement took place,
which caused the Spanish admiral to pursue his course to Calais Roads.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day the Lord High Admiral of the English fleet called on board
of his own ship, the “Arke-Royal,” and conferred the honor of knighthood
on the Lord Thomas Howard, the Lord Sheffield Roger Townshend, Martin
Frobisher, and John Hawkins, as a reward for their undaunted spirit and
bravery in this great fight at sea, having power from the Queen so to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>As brief biographical sketches of these important commanders may be
interesting, the following have been taken from various historical,
biographical, and genealogical works:—</p>
<h3 class='c018'>THE LORD HOWARD OF EFFINGHAM.</h3>
<p class='c021'>Charles, second Lord Howard of Effingham,
and Lord High Admiral of England, was son of the
first lord and grandson of Thomas, second Duke
of Norfolk.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was born 1536, and after much service was
appointed, in 1585, Lord High Admiral of England,
and was chief in command against the Spanish Armada,
in 1588.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he was a staunch Roman Catholic, history
will forever honor the tremendous efforts made by
him to frustrate the landing of this powerful combination
of land and sea forces, fitted out as it were
under the auspices of the Pope of Rome, and his
loyalty to his Queen and country.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1596, he commanded the fleet while the Earl
of Essex commanded the land forces in the expedition
against Cadiz. For this meritorious service
he was created Earl of Nottingham. In 1599, in
anticipation of another invasion by the King of
Spain, he was given the sole command of the army
and navy, with the title of Lieutenant-General of all
England. He commanded the troop that subdued
the Essex rebellion, and under James I. was employed
in several distinguished capacities, and died
December 14, 1624, aged eighty-eight, having some
years before resigned the office of Lord High Admiral,
in the behalf of the favorite Villiers, Earl of
Buckingham, receiving in exchange a pension of
£1,000, and the acquittal of a debt of £1,800 due
the Crown.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>THE LORD THOMAS HOWARD.</h3>
<p class='c021'>The Lord Thomas Howard was a son of the
fourth Duke of Norfolk. His lordship was a distinguished
commander in the memorable engagement
between the English fleet and the Spanish
Armada, in 1588.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1591 he had command of a squadron of ships
sent out to attack the Spanish Plate fleet, homeward
bound from America, and distinguished himself,
with Sir Thomas Vasseur, in capturing a part
of this fleet.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was, in 1596, in the fleet commanded by
Charles Howard, Lord High Admiral of England.
This Thomas Howard led the third squadron, and
it was this fleet which took the town of Cadiz.
The same year, on his return, he was summoned to
Parliament by the title of Lord Howard of Walden.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next year, to divert the Spaniard from a descent
on Ireland, the Queen sent out a fleet of one
hundred and twenty, divided into three squadrons,
commanded by the Earl of Essex, Lord Thomas
Howard, and Sir Walter Raleigh. On his return
to England, he was installed one of the Knights of
the Garter, May 24, 1597.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1601, he was one of the commanders of the
forces to whom the Earl of Essex surrendered, and
on the
19<sup>th</sup>
February following he was one of the
peers that sat on his trial, being then constable
of the Tower. Meeting King James I. at Theobalds,
in May, 1603, he was sworn of the Privy
Council, and July 21st following was advanced to
the Earldom of Suffolk. He was also made a Commissioner
for making Knights of the Bath, also for
executing the office of Earl Marshal of England.
In 1605, being Lord Chamberlain together with
the Lord Mounteagle, the Gunpowder Plot was
discovered. He was elected Chancellor of the University
of Cambridge in 1613, and July 11, 1614,
was constituted Lord High Treasurer of England.
The earl died in London, May 28, 1626.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>SIR ROGER TOWNSHEND.</h3>
<p class='c021'>Sir Roger Townshend of Raynham, Knight,
was descended, according to Collins and other
learned antiquaries, through a long line of ancestry
from Lodovic or Lewis, a Norman nobleman, who
married Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Sir Thomas
de Hauteville or Havile, Lord of Raynham, through
which match the Raynham estate came into the
family and is now the chief seat of the Marquis
Townshend.</p>

<p class='c009'>This Sir Roger was born about 1550, and was
heir to his great grandfather, Sir Roger Townshend,
Kt., whose will was proved at Norwich, Co.
Norfolk, May 10, 1552. He was a gentleman of
high rank and great worth in his native county
Norfolk, and while Spain was preparing the Invincible
Armada of 1588 to invade England, he manifested
the greatest spirit and energy in fitting out
and manning ships at his own expense to repel the
invaders, going in person in the cause of his country,
and on account of his undaunted spirit and bravery
in the several engagements previous to the
26<sup>th</sup>
of July, he was knighted that day on board the <i>Ark
Royal</i>, by the Admiral Lord Howard of Effingham,
who had power from Queen Elizabeth so to do.
This Sir Roger was in the thickest of the fight and
suffered the loss of many of his men, and we have
evidence from a letter dated at Margate, Kent,
August 10, 1588, in which Lord Howard writes
Burghley “that of all the men brought by Sir Roger
Townshend he has but one left alive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He lived but two years afterwards, dying in the
flower of his age at a seat he had purchased of
Thomas Sutton, Esq., at Newington, Co. Middlesex,
and was buried June 30, 1590, in the church of
St. Giles, Cripplegate, London.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>SIR JOHN HAWKINS.</h3>
<p class='c021'>Sir John Hawkins, a seaman of distinguished
ability who flourished during the reign of Elizabeth,
was born at Plymouth about 1520, and his
early life was spent in trading voyages to the south
of Europe and African coast. With the assistance
of several merchants he fitted out a small fleet in
1562, and obtained by force and purchase a cargo
of negroes, which he carried to the Spanish West
India Colonies and there sold them; this we believe
was the first adventure in the African slave trade
made by Englishmen.</p>

<p class='c009'>He made many voyages of this kind, and was
at last attacked by the Spanish authorities in the
Port of S. Juan de Ulloa, and saved only two of his
ships and returned to England in January, 1568,
after suffering much hardship. This was his last
commercial enterprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hawkins was appointed in 1573 treasurer of the
navy, and in 1588 we find him serving as Rear
Admiral against the Spanish Armada, and for his
great spirit and bravery he was knighted by the
Admiral Charles Lord Howard of Effingham. He
went to intercept the Plate fleet and harrass the
trade of Spain with Frobishers and others in 1590,
but failed in the first object and succeeded in the
second. In 1595, he was sent with Drake to command
an expedition against the Spaniards in the
West Indies; but they failed to agree and soon
after separated. Sir John Hawkins died November
21, 1595, and his colleague, Drake, soon after.
Hawkins founded a hospital at Chatham for poor
and sick seamen. He also sat in Parliament for
Plymouth.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>SIR MARTIN FROBISHER.</h3>
<p class='c021'>Sir Martin Frobisher was born at Doncaster,
Yorkshire, of humble parentage, and brought up to
the sea, and in early life displayed the talents of a
great navigator, and was the first Englishman who
attempted to find a northwest passage to China.
Under the patronage of Ambrose Dudley, Earl of
Warwick, he fitted out two barks of twenty-five
tons, and a pinnace of ten tons, and sailed from
Deptford, January 8, 1576, and on July
11<sup>th</sup>
discovered
Freeseland and the strait which still bears
his name, and after making numerous discoveries
he returned to England, arriving at Harwich 2d
October of the same year. On this voyage he took
possession of the country in Queen Elizabeth’s name
and brought back with him specimens of gold ore.
This circumstance raised prodigious expectations,
and the Queen lent him a ship of two hundred tons
for his next expedition, on which he sailed accompanied
with a party of one hundred and forty persons
(also two barks of thirty tons each) from
Gravesend, May 26, 1577. He made numerous discoveries,
but his instructions were to search for ore,
and being in the Countess of Warwick Island he
took a lading of it and arrived in England the
end of September, 1577, and was most graciously
received by the Queen, who fitted out another fleet
of twelve vessels which sailed from Harwich May
31, 1578, and sighted Freeseland June
20<sup>th</sup>,
and
took possession of the country in the Queen’s name,
calling it West England, and after collecting much
ore sailed for and arrived in England after a stormy
and dangerous passage in the beginning of October.
In 1588 he commanded the <i>Triumph</i> in the engagement
against the Spanish Armada and received the
honor of knighthood for his valor at sea by the
Lord High Admiral, 26 July of the same year. In
1590, he commanded a squadron to the Spanish
Coast, and in 1594 he was sent with four men-of-war
to the assistance of Henry IV. of France,
against a body of leaguers and Spaniards then in
possession of part of Brittany, who had fortified
themselves very strongly at Croyzon near Brest.
Here, in an assault upon that fort, November
7<sup>th</sup>,
he was wounded by a ball in the hip, of which he
died soon after he had brought the fleet safely back
to Plymouth, and was buried in that town.</p>
<h3 class='c018'>SIR WALTER RALEIGH.</h3>
<p class='c021'>Sir Walter Raleigh, a distinguished statesman,
scholar, and warrior, in the reigns of Elizabeth and
James I., was born in 1552, at Budleigh in Devonshire,
and educated at Oriel College, Oxford. At
the age of seventeen he made one of a troop of an
hundred gentlemen volunteers whom Queen Elizabeth
permitted to go to France, under the command
of Henry Champernon, for the service of the
Protestant princes. He next served in the Netherlands;
and, on his return from the Continent, his
half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, having obtained
a grant of lands in North America, he engaged
with a considerable number of gentlemen to
go out to Newfoundland: but the expedition proving
unsuccessful, Sir Walter returned to England,
after being exposed to several dangers, and proceeded
thence to Ireland, where he made his bravery
so conspicuous in quelling the insurgents, that
he was received at court with considerable favor,
and obtained permission and supplies to prosecute
his discoveries in America, which ended in his settling
a colony in that country, called, in honor of
his maiden sovereign, Virginia; and he is said to
have first introduced tobacco and potatoes into
Europe. In the mean time the Queen conferred on
him the distinction of knighthood, and rewarded
him by several lucrative grants, including a large
share of the forfeited Irish estates. When his country’s
safety was threatened by the famous Spanish
Armada, he raised and disciplined the militia of
Cornwall; and afterwards, by joining the fleet with
a squadron of ships belonging to gentlemen volunteers,
assisted in obtaining the signal victory which
it pleased Providence to give to the English over
the Spaniards on that occasion. He was now
made gentleman of the privy chamber; but shortly
after fell into disgrace, and was confined for some
months, partly on account of a tract which he had
published, entitled “the School for Atheists,” which
was unfairly construed by his enemies into a vindication
of atheistical principles; and partly for a
clandestine attachment to one of the Queen’s maids
of honor, the daughter of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton;
which lady, however, he afterwards honorably
married. During his seclusion he planned the discovery
of the extensive country of Guiana, in South
America, in which he took an active part himself,
as soon as he was set at liberty: but the season
being unfavorable, he returned to England, and was
soon after appointed to a command in the important
expedition to Cadiz, of which the success was
in a great measure owing to Sir Walter’s valor and
prudence. This, joined to several other important
services, restored him completely to the favor of
Elizabeth, towards the end of her reign. Her successor,
James, prejudiced against him by Robert
Cecil, disapproving of his martial spirit, and jealous
of his abilities, availed himself of a court conspiracy
against this great man, charging him with
participating in an attempt to place upon the throne
Arabella Stuart, and of carrying on a secret correspondence
with the King of Spain. By the base
subservience of the jury, he was brought in guilty
of high treason, even to the surprise of the Attorney-General
Coke himself, who declared that he had
only charged him with misprision of treason. Raleigh
was reprieved, and committed to the Tower,
where his wife, at her earnest solicitation, was allowed
to reside with him, and where his youngest
son was born. Twelve years was Sir Walter detained
a prisoner in the Tower; during which time,
besides various minor compositions, he wrote his
“History of the World;” a work distinguished for
the richness of its information, the judiciousness of
its reflections, and the vigor of its style. At length
his release was obtained, in 1616, by the advance of
a large sum of money to the new favorite, Villiers;
and, to retrieve his broken fortunes, he planned
another expedition to America. He obtained a
patent under the great seal for making a settlement
in Guiana; but, in order to retain a power
over him, the king did not grant him a pardon for
the sentence passed upon him for his alleged treason.
Having reached the Orinoco, he dispatched
a portion of his force to attack the new Spanish settlement
of St. Thomas, which was captured; but he
had to lament the death of his eldest son, who fell
on that occasion. The expected plunder proved of
little value: and Sir Walter, having in vain tried to
induce his captains to attack other Spanish settlements,
arrived at Plymouth in July, 1618. Being
brought before the court of King’s Bench, his plea of
an implied pardon by his subsequent command, was
overruled; and the doom of death being pronounced
against him, it was carried into execution the following
day, October 28, 1819, in Old Palace Yard.
His behavior at the scaffold was calm, and, after
addressing the people at some length in his own
justification, he received the stroke of death with
perfect composure; remarking to the sheriff, with
a smile, as he felt the edge of the axe, “This is a
sharp medicine, but it is a physician that will cure
all diseases.”</p>
<h3 class='c018'>JOHN PINE.</h3>
<p class='c021'>Very little is known of the parentage of John
Pine, the original engraver and publisher of this
work.</p>

<p class='c009'>He flourished between the years 1720-1750, and
ranked second to none in his profession. He was
a most intimate friend of Hogarth, who showed his
admiration for him by painting him in the manner
of Rembrandt.</p>

<p class='c009'>The years of his birth and death are uncertain.
His chief works are the Ceremonies used at the Revival
of the Order of the Bath; a splendid edition
of Horace, illustrated with copies of antiques, bas-reliefs,
gems, and coins: also a print of the House
of Commons.</p>

<p class='c009'>His engravings of the tapestry hangings of the
House of Lords are sufficient evidence of his ability
as an engraver. These splendid representations of
the engagements between the English fleet and the
Spanish Armada were destroyed by fire when the
Houses of Parliament were burned, Oct. 16, 1834.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='label'><a href='#r114'>114</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One Night, as the Queen was in the Camp, guarded by her
Army, the Lord Treasurer <i>Burleigh</i> came thither, and delivered to
the Earl of <i>Leicester</i> the Examination of Don <i>Pedro</i>, who was taken
and brought in by Sir <i>Francis Drake</i>; the Sum of which was
this: Don <i>Pedro</i> being asked what was the Intent of their coming,
stoutly answer’d the Lords, What, but to subdue your Nation, and
root it out. Good, said the Lords, and what meant you then to do
with the Catholicks? He answered, We meant to send them (good
Men) directly unto Heaven, as all you that are Hereticks to Hell.
Yea but, said the Lords, What meant you to do with your Whips
of Cord and Wyer? (whereof they had great Store in their Ships,)
What, said he, we meant to whip you Hereticks to Death, that
have assisted my Master’s Rebels, and done such Dishonours to our
Catholick King and People. Yea, but what would you have done
said they, with their young Children. They, said he, which were
above seven Years old should have gone the Way their Fathers
went; the rest should have lived, branded in the Forehead with the
Letter <i>L</i>, for <i>Lutheran</i>, to perpetual Bondage,
<i>Cabala</i>, p. 372. Letter to <i>Mendoza</i>, p. 37.——It was also
published, that the Lords of <i>Spain</i> which were in the Navy, had
made a special Division amongst themselves, of all the Noblemens Houses
in <i>England</i> by their Names, and had in a sort quartered
<i>England</i> among themselves, and had determined of sundry manners of
cruel Death, both of the Nobility and the rest of the People. The
Ladies, Women, and Maidens were also destined to all Villany; the rich
Merchants Houses in <i>London</i> were put into a Register, by their
very Names, and limited to the Companies of the Squadrons of the Navy
for their Spoil. Letter to <i>Mendoza</i>, p. 37.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
